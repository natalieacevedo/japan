                <p class="description-joao">Mount Fuji is Japan's highest mountain with 3776 meters. This mountain has been worshiped as a sacred mountain and it's very popular throughout the world. If you want to enjoy Mount Fuji at a more leisurely pace and from a nice natural surrounding, you should head to the Fuji Five Lake (Fujigoko) region at the northern foot of the mountain, or to Hakone, a nearby hot spring resort. Mount Fuji is officially open for climbing during July and August via several routes.</p>
